Image Downloader is a demo app that demonstrates how to download (and save) an image on Android in six different ways:

* using an own implementation
* using the built-in [DownloadManager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html)

.. or using one of the following popular libraries:

* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
* [Fresco](https://github.com/facebook/fresco)
* [Universal Image Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader)
* [Volley](https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley)

This project aims to give a basic understanding of how downloading/displaying/saving an image works on Android. 

If you have any feedback, suggestions on what should be improved or you just found a bug - I welcome your pull requests.
